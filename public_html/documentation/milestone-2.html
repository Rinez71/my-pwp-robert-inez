<h1>Milestone 2</h1>
<section class="content-strategy">
	<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
	<p>My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:</p>
	<h3>Navbar</h3>
	<p>This navbar will sit at the top of the screen with links to various sections on the right. In my navbar I will be including my name and logo on the left with a solid colored background.</p>
	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>The about me section will be starting out with my "Why". I will include the reason why I develop websites. I will also include a short synopsis of who I am and some icons of the hobbies I enjoy outside of work. I will also include a picture of myself in my about me on the left of my text.</p>
	<h3>Portfolio</h3>
	<p>This part of my site will be a place for me to house projects that I create. I will be including a thumbnail of each project, the and a brief explanation of what the project is and why it's useful. I will also include the technologies I use in the page break under my portfolio.</p>
	<h3>Experience</h3>
	<p>In this section I will be including a timeline of my past work experiences and where I worked. This will also include how long I was employed/contracted with this organization. This timeline will be created using a combination of CSS and Bootstrap4. I will use CSS to make the vertical line spanning the center of page. I will then use Bootstrap4 to create cards on side of the timeline alternating the left and right. I will also include a png of the Deepdive logo and Eagle, Globe, and Anchor under my experience.</p>
	<h3>Contact Me!</h3>
	<p>Lastly I will include a contact form for potential clients or employers to reach out to me. This will also be a place I am able to show </p>
